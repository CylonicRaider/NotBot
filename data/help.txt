Use !notify to send messages to other people who are currently unavailable.
        !notify @PERSON MESSAGE
Use !group and !ungroup to add yourself to a group that can send and receive messages just like a person.
        !group *GROUP @PERSON
        !ungroup *GROUP @PERSON

Want to have an instance of @NotBot in another room? Just send me (@jedevc) a !notify.
