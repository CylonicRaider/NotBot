Use !notify to send messages to other people who are currently unavailable.
        !notify @PERSON (@PERSON2 @PERSON3...) (--) MESSAGE
        !notify *GROUP (--) MESSAGE
(Use a double dash before the message if starts with an @-mention.)
Use !group and !ungroup to add yourself (or anyone else) to a group that can send and receive messages just like a person.
        !group *GROUP @PERSON (@PERSON2 @PERSON3...)
        !ungroup *GROUP @PERSON (@PERSON2 @PERSON3...)
Use !grouplist to see all the groups and to see their occupants.
        !grouplist
        !grouplist (-ping) *GROUP
(Use -ping to @-mention all members of the group.)

@NotBot also obeys the euphorian bot standards.
